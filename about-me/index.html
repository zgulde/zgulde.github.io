<p>Hi! My name is Zach. While I like to think I am many things to many
different people, this site is mainly devoted to my techy side. I
currently work for <a href="http://codeup.com">Codeup</a>, which is a
program that turns people from all walks of life into web developers and
data scientists. I enjoy automating things, solving technical puzzles,
data visualizations, and command line applications.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about finding solutions (usually involving software
and data) that are the right size for the problem at hand. Too many
times I’ve seen solutions implemented where long-term consequences are
not considered, or the opposite, where the solution is too unweildy
because it is built for some far off large scale future that never
arrives.</p>
<p>Outside of technical matters (work and non-work related), I enjoy
spending time with my wife and 7 year old, cooking, making music and
videos, and playing video games. I’d be thrilled to talk to you
about:</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Innovative ways to display data with data journalism</li>
<li>Text editors or your development environment in general (I’m a tool
nerd)</li>
<li>Electric or acoustic guitars and guitar accessories</li>
<li>What linux distribution you’re using</li>
<li>New developments in the python data science library world</li>
<li>Music production, sound design, and sound engineering</li>
<li>Cool command line applications</li>
<li>The joys and struggles of parenting</li>
<li>Interesting software bugs you’ve found</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to check out my (far from polished) <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline"

to listen to music I’ve made</a> or <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline"
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYwDkJnXxYyQQdw48SfS7Qg">my
youtube channel</a> if you want to see the several attempts I’ve made at
educational videos for data science topics outside of my work at Codeup.</p>
